		<h3>The eyes Explained</h3>
	</header>

<h3>Farsightedness</h3>

	<p>Objects that are far away are mostly clear, while objects close by are blurry. This happens when the eyeball is too short, or the cornea is abnormally shaped. </p>

<h3>Astigmatism</h3>

	<p>Is a common eye problem that can make your vision blurry or distorted. It happens when your cornea (the clear front layer of your eye) or lens (an inner part of your eye that helps the eye focus) has a different shape than normal. The only way to find out if you have astigmatism is to get an eye exam. Eyeglasses or contact lenses can help you see better and some people can get surgery to fix their astigmatism.</p>

<h3>Nearsightedness</h3>

	<p>Is when a person can see nearby objects 
	clearly, but when objects are far away, they get blurry. Someone might have trouble clearly making out people on a television screen. A child might have difficulty reading the chalkboard in school. This condition occurs if the eyeball is too long, or if the cornea is too curved. </p>

 <h3>Symptoms of Needing Glasses</h3>

		<p>Every two years, you should have a comprehensive eye exam in a qualified doctor’s office to screen for any visual abnormalities. Some issues will be identified early enough and the appropriate treatment prescribed. Notwithstanding, some symptoms of needing glasses can vary based on the kind of eye issue you’re having. Some common symptoms include: <strong>blurred vision, double vision, fuzziness, headaches, squinting, “halos” around them in bright light, eyestrain, distorted vision and trouble seeing and driving. </strong> The most common kinds of vision problems are refractive errors. Trusted Source. This term includes: <em>nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism. </em> Since improved vision is the whole point of wearing glasses, but the difference can be startling. Words on a page that were only previously accessible via squinting now jump out at you with ease. Street signs are much clearer, as are the cars around you, and everything has much more detail than you ever imagined. </p>

During the refraction test, you will be asked to look through a special device called a <strong>phoropter</strong> while focusing on an eye chart about 10-20 feet away. Your eye doctor will then place different lenses in front of your eyes to see which one provides the clearest vision.</td>

During this test, you will focus on a target, typically the “E” on the eye chart, as your eye doctor shines a light at your eye, while looking through a number of lenses. Based on the way the light reflects from your eye, your eye doctor can estimate the lens power that will work best to correct your vision.</td>

<h1>Glasses Care Tips</h1>

<p>To provide your glasses with longevity, you need to act upon these tips. Acting upon this tip increases your glasses’ life and helps you look beautiful, stylish, and sober.</p>

<ul>
		<li><strong>Place them carefully</strong> - Many people are seen that do not take care while placing their glasses. They put them roughly and sometimes place glasses in dirty places with lenses downward. In this way, the lenses become dirty and continuous cleaning makes the glasses more blurry. So, properly putting them can help you save money.</li>
	
	
		<li><strong>Wash regularly</strong> - It looks strange to hear about washing the glasses, but it is an excellent tip for cleaning the glasses. It is because doing it will help the lenses to stay in optimal condition thoroughly. Another benefit of washing glasses once daily is that it removes the dust, dirt, and smudges that are difficult to remove with a simple cloth.</li>
	
	
		<li><strong>Use a glasses cloth</strong> - Most people use paper towels, tissues, napkins, or any cloth to clean the lenses, which is never suitable for glasses. A specific material is used to clean the lenses, which does not leave any scratches on the glasses. So, always consider using a proper cloth to clean them.</li>
</ul>
